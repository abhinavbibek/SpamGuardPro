## Overview

This Python project, "SpamGuard Pro," is designed to classify emails into two categories: "ham" (legitimate) and "spam" (unsolicited or unwanted). It leverages Scikit-Learn for machine learning, Pandas for data handling, and other libraries for data preprocessing, analysis, and evaluation.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection:** 
- Collect your email dataset and organize it into directories, such as 'ham' and 'spam,' as seen in the provided code.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
- Ensure that you have installed the required packages and libraries.
- Review the `preprocessor` function in the code to customize text preprocessing according to your needs.

3. **Model Training:**
- The project uses a logistic regression model for email classification. You can explore other classifiers or machine learning models for your specific task.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
- After training the model, evaluate its performance by running the code.
- Review the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for insights into the model's performance.

5. **Results:**
- The project provides insights into the most important features for distinguishing between spam and ham emails. You can customize and extend the analysis as needed.

## Data Collection
- The code expects the email dataset to be organized into two directories: 'ham' and 'spam.'
- It reads and processes email content from these directories for training and evaluation.

## Data Preprocessing
- The `preprocessor` function is responsible for preprocessing email content.
- It currently converts all text to lowercase, but you can customize it for more advanced preprocessing steps.

## Model Training
- The code uses logistic regression as the classifier for email classification.
- You can explore other classifiers available in Scikit-Learn for your specific use case.

## Model Evaluation
- The project provides detailed information on the model's performance, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report.

## Results
- The top positive and negative features associated with spam and ham emails are printed to provide insights into the model's decision-making process.
